    <h2>Doop technology demo</h2>
    <p>Doop is a rails ruby gem which provides a generator to get you quickly started converting govuk paper forms into online applications.  

    This is a demo of how a <strong><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/359765/ch2-flat.pdf">Child Benefit paper application form</a></strong> could be realized as an online questionnaire, where questions are progresively
    asked and question flows altered based on responses. </p>

    <h3>The code</h3>
    <p>As you progress through the questionnaire, you can follow along in the code:<br/><br/>

    <strong><a href="">ChildbenController.rb</a></strong><br/>
    <strong><a href="">_before_you_begin.html.erb</a></strong><br/>
    <strong><a href="">_preamble.html.erb</a></strong><br/>
    <strong><a href="">_about_you.html.erb</a></strong><br/>
    <strong><a href="">_children.html.erb</a></strong><br/>
    <strong><a href="">_declaration.html.erb</a></strong><br/>
    </p>


    <h3>The YAML</h3>
    <p>The question structure is described using YAML.  As questions are answered, the YAML structure is updated to reflect the current state
    of the questionnaire.  The YAML structure is then sent back to the browser and stored in a hidden field.  When the next question is answered
    the submission include the hidden YAML, which is then updated to reflect the next answer... and so on.  In production, the hidden field is 
    encrypted and signed, to guarentee its authenticity.  Since the data is stored in the users browser, the application can be considered stateless
    , which makes it very scalable.</p>

    <h3>View the saved YAML</h3>
    <p>For the demo, at any point you can view the current YAML by hitting <strong>Ctrl-Y</strong></p>

    <h3>Testing</h3>
    <p>Doop defines a set of Rspec extensions, to make acceptance testing more natural.  See <a href="">here</a> for the acceptance tests covering
    the demo.</p>
